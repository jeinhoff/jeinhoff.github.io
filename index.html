        <p></p>
        
        <p>Thank you for visiting my website.</p>
                
        <p>I am a PhD Candidate at the DYNAMICS Research Training Group, a joint programme of Humboldt University and the Hertie School in Berlin, funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). I was a visiting researcher at the Finnish Centre for Pensions in 2023 and at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2024. Later in 2024, I will be visiting Nuffield College in Oxford.</p>

        <p>My research interests include life course dynamics, social stratification, comparative social policy, and novel quantitative methods for causal inference. For my dissertation, I investigate the class stratification of work-to-retirement transitions in the context of population aging and extending working life policies in Europe. I use a wide range of quantitative methods, including sequence and decomposition analyses as well as targeted machine learning approaches. I also like to work with the potential outcomes framework and graphical causal models.</p>

        <p>Besides my PhD research, I work as a Consultant at the OECD's Directorate for Science, Technology and Innovation, where I contribute to reviews of national innovation policy and a project exploring natural language processing tools and large language models for innovation policy analysis. In 2024, I was selected as a Young Thinker at the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS) to discuss policy priorities for the European elections.</p>

        <p>You can find my CV <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="files/cv_einhoff.pdf">here</a>.</p>

        <p>Here are some of my current research projects:</p>

          <p><b>Abstract:</b> Across Europe, the extension of working lives has been a central policy goal for more than two decades. Working life expectancy (WLE) and working years lost (WYL) are well-suited demographic indicators for assessing countries’ progress towards achieving this goal. This article first reviews all available estimates of WLE and WYL for European countries. It then uses the largest available micro-level data – the European Labour Force Surveys (n > 10 million) – to estimate and project WLEs and WYL for cohorts of men and women aged 55–64 and 65–74 in 21 European countries. The results show that WLEs have generally increased, most rapidly in Central and Eastern Europe and in Western Europe. Northern European countries reach the highest levels of WLEs. However, country and gender differences remain large, especially when WLEs are adjusted for working hours. Correlational analyses suggest that working years have been gained primarily from successive cohorts losing fewer working years to retirement. The remaining WYL to retirement, to inactivity among women, and to unemployment in Southern Europe will be the main barriers to a further extension of working lives over the coming years.<br>

          <p><b>Abstract:</b> Despite its major role in generating and consolidating social inequalities, too little is known about the impact of housing on critical life course transitions. This article studies the effects of home ownership on the risks of retirement from age 51 to 65 in two distinct country contexts. After delineating the causal estimands and identification conditions, the analysis uses the novel doubly-robust and non-parametric Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation technique with panel data from the SOEP (n = 12,234) and BHPS/UKHLS (n = 12,234). Compared to renting, home ownership is found to raise individuals’ retirement risks by up to 14,5% (±4,7%) in the UK and up to 6,1% (±3,4%) in Germany. The effects vary strongly by age and are largest shortly before key statutory age thresholds and among outright homeowners. These findings highlight housing as a dimension of social stratification in work-to-retirement transitions and demonstrate the potential of novel statistical approaches for life course research. <br>

          <b>Abstract:</b> The flexibilisation of retirement is often proposed as a policy to promote longer working lives. In this paper, I use Competing Trajectory Analysis, a combination of sequence and event history analysis, and data from the SHARE to study how widespread "flexible" retirement transitions have become among men and women in different class positions and whether they are associated with later exits from the labour market.<br>

          <b>Abstract:</b> Prior research has argued that gender differences in late working life and retirement transitions stem largely from men’s and women’s unequal positions in the occupational hierarchy. In this paper, I revisit this claim and quantify the contribution of occupational gender segregation to (dis-)advantages in late working life trajectories by using a novel causal decomposition technique based on linked administrative and survey data from the SOEP and the German Pension Fund.<br>
