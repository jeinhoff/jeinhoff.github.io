        <p></p>
        
        <p>Thank you for visiting my website.</p>
                
        <p> I am a PhD Candidate at the DYNAMICS Research Training Group, a joint programme of Humboldt University and the Hertie School in Berlin funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). I have been a visiting researcher at the Finnish Centre for Pension in 2023 and at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2024. Later in 2024 I will be visiting Nuffield College in Oxford.
        
        <p> My research interests span life course dynamics, social stratification and comparative social policy as well as novel quantitative methods for causal inference. For my dissertation, I investigate the class stratification of work-to-retirement transitions in the context of population ageing and extending working life policies in Europe. I use a wide range of quantitative methods, including sequence and decomposition analyses as well as targeted and machine learning approaches. I also like to work with the potential outcomes framework and graphical causal models. </p>
         
        <p> Besides my PhD research, I work as a Consultant at the Directorate for Science, Technology and Innovation of the OECD where I contribute to reviews of national innovation policy as well as to a project that explores natural language processing tools and large language models for innovation policy analysis. For 2024, I have been selected as a Young Thinker at the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS). </p>

        <p> I completed my studies in sociology and public policy at the University of Mannheim, the Hertie School and Bocconi University. During this time I gained international work experience in the public and private sectors and was a Student Research Assistant at the Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES) and the WZB Berlin Social Science Center. </p>
        
        <p> Please reach out by e-mail or via Twitter if you are interested in my research or would like to have a chat. </p>
