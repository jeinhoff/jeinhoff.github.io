        <p></p>
        
        <p>Thank you for visiting my website.</p>
                
        <p>I am a PhD Candidate at the DYNAMICS Research Training Group, a joint programme of Humboldt University and the Hertie School in Berlin, funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). I was a visiting researcher at the Finnish Centre for Pensions in 2023 and at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2024. Later in 2024, I will be visiting Nuffield College in Oxford.</p>

        <p>My research interests include life course dynamics, social stratification, comparative social policy, and novel quantitative methods for causal inference. For my dissertation, I investigate the class stratification of work-to-retirement transitions in the context of population aging and extending working life policies in Europe. I use a wide range of quantitative methods, including sequence and decomposition analyses, as well as targeted and machine learning approaches. I also enjoy working with the potential outcomes framework and graphical causal models.</p>

        <p>Besides my PhD research, I work as a Consultant at the OECD's Directorate for Science, Technology and Innovation, where I contribute to reviews of national innovation policy and a project exploring natural language processing tools and large language models for innovation policy analysis. In 2024, I was selected as a Young Thinker at the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS) to discuss policy priorities for the European elections.</p>

        <p>I completed my studies in sociology and public policy at the University of Mannheim, the Hertie School, and Bocconi University. During this time, I gained international work experience in both the public and private sectors and was a Student Research Assistant at the Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES) and the WZB Berlin Social Science Center.</p>
