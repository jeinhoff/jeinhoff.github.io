        <p></p>
        
        <p>Thank you for visiting my website.</p>
                
        <p>I am a PhD candidate at the Research Training Group „The Dynamics of Demography, Democratic Processes and Public Policy” (DYNAMICS). DYNAMICS is a joint programme of the Hertie School and Humboldt University, generously funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). </p>
        
        <p>For my dissertation I plan to study the effects of structural and institutional change in the labour market on inequalities in late careers and retirement from a comparative perspective using sequence analysis and related quantitative methods.</p>
 
        <p>I completed my studies in sociology and public policy at the University of Mannheim, the Hertie School and Bocconi University. During this time I gained international work experience in the public and private sectors and was a Student Research Assistant at the Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES) and the WZB Berlin Social Science Center.</p>
        
        <p>I am currently also a Consultant at the Directorate for Science, Technology and Innovation of the OECD where I contribute to a review of Germany’s innovation system and a project that explores natural language processing tools for innovation policy analysis.</p>
                
        <p>Please reach out by e-mail or via Twitter if you are interested in my research and/or would like to have a chat.</p>
