        <p>Jan Einhoff is a PhD candidate at the Research Training Group „The Dynamics of Demography, Democratic Processes and Public Policy” (DYNAMICS).</p>
 
        <p>Jan holds degrees in sociology and public policy from the University of Mannheim, the Hertie School and Bocconi University. During his studies he gained international work experience in the public and private sector and was a Student Research Assistant at the Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES) and the WZB Berlin Social Science Center.</p>
        
        <p>Jan is currently a Consultant at the Directorate for Science, Technology and Innovation of the OECD where he contributes to a review of Germany’s innovation system and a project that explores natural language processing tools for innovation policy analysis.</p>
 
        <p>His main interests include life course, social stratification, and comparative welfare state research. For his dissertation he plans to study the effects of pension and labour market policies on inequalities in retirement from a comparative perspective using sequence analysis and related quantitative methods.</p>
        
        <p>I will use this website to share my research outputs and ongoing projects.</p>
