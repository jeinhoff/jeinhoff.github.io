        <p>1. <b>Cohorts' Working Life Expectancies and Working Years Lost in 21 European countries</b> (<i>submitted</i>)</p>

        <p><img src="files/wle_results.jpg"></p>
        
        <p><b>Abstract:</b> Across Europe, the extension of working lives has been a central policy goal for more than two decades. Working life expectancy (WLE) and working years lost (WYL) are well-suited demographic indicators for assessing countries’ progress towards achieving this goal. This article first reviews all available estimates of WLE and WYL for European countries. It then uses the largest available micro-level data – the European Labour Force Surveys (n > 10 million) – to estimate and project WLEs and WYL for cohorts of men and women aged 55–64 and 65–74 in 21 European countries. The results show that WLEs have generally increased, most rapidly in Central and Eastern Europe and in Western Europe. Northern European countries reach the highest levels of WLEs. However, country and gender differences remain large, especially when WLEs are adjusted for working hours. Correlational analyses suggest that working years have been gained primarily from successive cohorts losing fewer working years to retirement. The remaining WYL to retirement, to inactivity among women, and to unemployment in Southern Europe will be the main barriers to a further extension of working lives over the coming years.</p>

        <p>4. <b>Occupational classes and the gender gap in late working life (dis-) advantages. Causal decomposition analyses based on linked survey and administrative data from Germany.</b> (<i>Work in progress</i>)</p>

        <p><b>Abstract:</b> Earlier research has argued that gender differences in late working life and retirement transitions stem largely from men’s and women’s unequal occupational class positions. In this paper, I revisit this argument and quantify the contribution of occupational gender segregation to (dis-)advantages in late working life trajectories by using a novel causal decomposition technique based on linked administrative and survey data from the SOEP and German Pension Fund.</p>
